# BoliviAround
Between the lines is the website of a travel agency organizing travels in Bolivia. 
The aim is to create an online space for them to make clients discover their travels' offers.
Different experiences are described to the user - focusing on adventures, party or food interests.
Several locations linked to these interests are then displayed.
In case the client is interested, he can then contact the agency through a contact form.

##UX

*External users goals*

*Internal users goals*

##Wireframes

I used Balsamic to build my wireframe prior to the website coding. 
The idea was to get an idea of what sections I would build and what design I would roughly 
create. Wireframes are built regarding desktop, tablet and phone versions.
