# BoliviAround
BoliviAround is the website of a travel agency organizing travels in Bolivia. 
The aim is to create an online space for them to make clients discover their travels' offers, and eventually to contact the travel agency.
Different experiences, with locations displayed, are described to the user - focusing on adventure, party or food interests. 
To highlight the efficency of the travel agency, testimonies from users are also presented.

_UX_

*External users goals*

*Internal users goals*

_Wireframes_

I used Balsamic to build my wireframe prior to the website coding. 
The idea was to get an idea of what sections I would build and what design I would roughly 
create. Wireframes are built regarding desktop, tablet and phone versions.

Thank you to my mentor, Aaron, who gave me advices and support this project.

Eventually I received help for my code by reading answers from questions on the websites:

*[W3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/)
*[MdBootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/) - especially : to make the navbar collapses in responsive version after clicking on a nav-link, I used the code from this [post](https://mdbootstrap.com/support/general/auto-close-navbar-when-click-on-link-responsive-mode/)
*[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - especially : to customize my map, I followed the code guidelines from the following [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28499141/how-to-change-google-map-center-by-clicking-a-button/28500306)
*[Web-eau](https://www.web-eau.net/) : especially : to customize my images with CSS effects (zoom, color), I followed the code guidelines from the following [post](https://www.web-eau.net/blog/15-effets-css3-pour-vos-images)
